I am pursuing a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science) at the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu). I am conducting research on Mamba model at the [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), under the supervision of [Prof. Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I previously worked on open-vocabulary 3D object detection at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn) at Tsinghua University with [Prof. Li Yi (Eric)](https://ericyi.github.io).

Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electronic Information Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn), where I conducted research on few-shot learning under the supervision of [Prof. Peihua Li](https://www.peihuali.org), worked on underwater object detection in [IIAU-Lab](https://futureschool.dlut.edu.cn/IIAU.htm) under the supervision of [Prof. Dong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nVgPQpoAAAAJ&hl=en), researched video segmentation under the supervision of [Prof. Shenglan Liu](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/liushenglan/en/index.htm), and worked on image monitoring for the crystallization process under the supervision of [Prof. Tao Liu](http://act.dlut.edu.cn/English.htm). I also interned at [Panasonic Electrical Software Development (Dalian) Co. LTD](https://panasonic.cn/psdcd/).
