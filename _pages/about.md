I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science) at the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electronic Information Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn).

I am also conducting research on Mamba at the [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), under the supervision of Prof. [Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I previously worked on open-vocabulary 3D object detection at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn) at Tsinghua University with Prof. [Li Yi (Eric)](https://ericyi.github.io).
